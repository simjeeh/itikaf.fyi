# What is it?
Iʿtikāf is a spiritual retreat and an Emphasized Communal Sunnah (Sunnah Muakkadah ʿalā al-Kifāyah) for the last 10 nights of Ramaḍān

# How to Perform Iʿtikāf
* Can't leave the masjid (unless for bathroom, food, Jumuʿah)
* Don't stay silent (disliked, we're not monks)
* No intercourse/foreplay
   * It will invalidate the retreat
* Can eat/sleep/buy/sell in the masjid
   * Keep products outside - if inside, it's disliked (makrūh taḥrīman)
* Only speak good

**Women**: Same rules apply but can be done in your "designated praying area" at home
* If you don't have one, you can designate a spot at that time
* It can be done at the masjid

## **Rule of thumb**:
### Maximize time inside the masjid
   * Leave if there's a need that cannot be fulfilled from inside the masjid
   * Return when that need is taken care of
