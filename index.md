## What is it?
Itikah is a spiritual retreat and an Emphasized Communal Sunnah (Sunnah Muakkadah ala al-Kifayah) for the last 10 nights of Ramadan

## How to Perform Itikaf
* Can't leave the masjid (unless for bathroom, food, Jumu'ah)
* Don't stay silent (disliked, we're not monks)
* No intercourse/foreplay
  * It will invalidate the retreat
* Can eat/sleep/buy/sell in the masjid
  * Keep products outside - if inside, it's disliked (makruh tahriman)
* Only speak good

**Women**: Same rules apply but can be done in your "designated praying area" at home
 * If you don't have one, you can designate a spot at that time
 * It can be done at the masjid
